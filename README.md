# Introduction
This is a simple file uploader based on PHP (7.2) which implements file mime sniffing, a type whitelist, a maximum file size, and basic security measures. Built on pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks used.

# Notes
To produce a simple product, this uploader does not store files outside of the public www/public_html directory. I strongly recommend storing all uploaded files out of public access.
